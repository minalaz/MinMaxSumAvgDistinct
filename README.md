# MinMaxSumAvgDistinct
Assignment16 for homework on IT Bootcamp course/Task1:

- Make a static method in main that works like min, max, sum, avg and distinct in SQL using ArrayList<Integer>. You don't have to make another class except main, and the methods accept ArrayList<Integer> as a parameter. Distinct returns a new ArrayList<Integer> while other methods have return types int (for min, max and sum) and double (for avg).
